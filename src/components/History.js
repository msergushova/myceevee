          Until the middle of the 19th century, the territory of present Khabarovsk, in accordance with the Treaty of Nerchinsk, was a neutral territory between the Ch’ing Empire and the Russian Empire.

In 1858, an agreement was signed, according to which the entire left bank of the Amur became part of the Russian Empire, the right bank passed into the possession of China. After the agreement was signed, a military post named Khabarovka was founded. It was named after Yerofey Khabarov, the Russian explorer of the 17th century.

In 1865, the population of the settlement was 1294 people, mostly soldiers and officers. By 1880, it was quite a large settlement with 2036 people. In 1893, Khabarovka was renamed in Khabarovsk.

During the Civil War, power in Khabarovsk changed several times. In 1922, it became part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. After the establishment of Soviet power, Khabarovsk intensively developed in the economic, social and cultural spheres. In 1925, the railway bridge across the Amur River was restored. In 1936, the railway between Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-on-Amur was built. In 1934-1939, the city became the administrative center of the Khabarovsk region.

Today, Khabarovsk is a large industrial, transport, cultural, educational and scientific center of the Far East.

In 2002, Khabarovsk received the status of the administrative center of Far Eastern Federal district of Russia. In 2008, the railway station was completely renovated. In 2012, Khabarovsk received the honorary title of “City of Military Glory.” In the late summer - early autumn 2013, Khabarovsk was exposed to flooding, which became the strongest flooding for the entire observation period from 1897.
